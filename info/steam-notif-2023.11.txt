It is time for the November 2023 Stable Update!

It has been another exciting month. This month's release contains fixes for various gameplay inconsistencies with Terraria. Dye visuals, boss item drops, bomb damage, tool speed, and echo coating have all received fixes to match Terraria behavior. We are extremely grateful to the users that reported these issues to us. The mod configuration menu has been reworked to be less confusing for mods with multiple configuration pages. 

As always, if you are having issues of any sort, definitely don't hesitate to check out our [url=https://github.com/tModLoader/tModLoader/wiki/Basic-tModLoader-Usage-FAQ]FAQ on GitHub [/url] or reach out to us at [url=https://discord.com/invite/tmodloader]our Discord[/url]. 

[h1]Important News for Mod Makers[/h1]

We have exciting news for modders working in a team. Modders added as a "Contributor" to a mod on the Steam workshop will soon be able to publish updates for the mod to the workshop directly. Mod owners should take some time this month to ensure that everyone listed as a "Contributor" on the Steam workshop for your mod is trustworthy enough for this responsibility. Please remove any contributors that do not meet this standard. 

The feature for contributor publishing will be active November 21st starting with our preview releases to provide time to act. Please spread the word to other mod teams you know that might not have seen this announcement. 

We look forward to this feature enabling mods to more reliably update to fix bugs that arise.
